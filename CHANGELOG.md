## [1.10.7] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

#### Phase 11 False Positive Reduction - DeFi Detectors

Major FP reduction for 4 DeFi-related detectors that were incorrectly flagging simple tokens and non-pool contracts.

**amm-liquidity-manipulation**
- Fixed operator precedence bug: `&& burn || mint` was parsing as `(... && burn) || mint`, causing ANY contract with "mint" to be flagged
- Added `has_amm_patterns()` context gating requiring 2+ AMM indicators before flagging:
  - Both addLiquidity AND removeLiquidity functions
  - Reserve tracking (reserve0/reserve1, getReserves)
  - Swap functionality
  - LP token mechanics
  - Pool-related contract naming

**token-supply-manipulation**
- Skip constructors and initializers (represent fixed supply at deployment)
- Skip internal `_mint` functions (not externally callable)
- Only flag contracts with external/public mint functions that can be called post-deployment
- Added `has_external_mint_function()` helper to detect accessible mint paths

**jit-liquidity-sandwich**
- Added `has_liquidity_pool_patterns()` requiring 2+ indicators before flagging
- Skip interface files (define signatures, not vulnerable implementations)
- Flag at specific function lines instead of line 1
- Tightened liquidity function matching to require explicit liquidity context
- Changed `withdraw`/`deposit` checks to require "liquidity" in context

**cross-l2-frontrunning / escape-hatch-dependency**
- Added `is_l2_contract()` utility to detect L2/cross-chain contracts
- Only flag contracts with actual cross-chain functionality (bridge interfaces, L2 messaging, rollup patterns)
- Prevents false positives on simple L1 contracts with withdraw functions

### Added

- `is_l2_contract()` - Detects L2/cross-chain contracts via bridge imports, L2 terminology, messaging functions
- `is_governance_contract()` - Detects governance patterns (voting, proposals, timelock)
- `is_multisig_contract()` - Detects multi-signature wallet patterns

**Impact:**
- Simple ERC20 tokens no longer flagged by AMM/supply/JIT detectors
- Interfaces no longer flagged by JIT detector
- L1 contracts no longer flagged by L2-specific detectors
- All 604 detector tests pass

## [1.10.6] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

#### False Positive Reduction - constructor-reentrancy

Fixed false positive where `constructor-reentrancy` detector incorrectly flagged ERC20's `_mint()` as callback-triggering.

**Root Cause:** The detector treated `_mint` as a callback-triggering operation, but ERC20's `_mint()` does NOT have any callback mechanism - only ERC721/ERC1155's `_safeMint()` triggers receiver callbacks via `onERC721Received`/`onERC1155Received`.

**Changes:**
- Removed `_mint` from general callback detection
- Added specific patterns that DO trigger callbacks:
  - `_safeMint` (ERC721/ERC1155)
  - `safeTransferFrom` (ERC721/ERC1155)
  - `_safeTransfer` (ERC721/ERC1155)
  - `onERC721Received` / `onERC1155Received`
- Updated finding message to accurately describe which functions trigger callbacks
- Added 6 unit tests verifying correct behavior

**Impact:**
- Simple ERC20 tokens no longer flagged incorrectly
- Upgradeable ERC20 tokens (UUPS, etc.) no longer flagged incorrectly
- ERC721/ERC1155 contracts using `_safeMint()` still correctly flagged

## [1.10.3] - 2025-01-17

  - Severity: Low

### False Positive Reduction - Phase 4

This release continues reducing false positives across 10 detectors. **Target: ~12% reduction (~900 fewer findings)**.

### Changed

#### Priority 1: High-Impact Fixes

| Detector | Fix Applied |
|----------|-------------|
| `parameter-consistency` | Context-aware validation - only flag addresses used in risky operations (transfer, call, delegatecall, storage writes). Skip standard ERC function parameters. |
| `circular-dependency` | Replaced generic "external call without depth limit" with specific recursive pattern detection (self-calls, address(this) delegatecall). |
| `validator-front-running` | Multi-level filtering - skip access-controlled, internal/private, view/pure functions. Only flag liquidation/arbitrage/competitive claim patterns. |
| `amm-k-invariant-violation` | Tightened AMM detection to require strong signals (reserve0/reserve1, IUniswapV2Pair) or 3+ medium indicators. |

#### Priority 2: Medium-Impact Fixes

| Detector | Fix Applied |
|----------|-------------|
| `swc105-unprotected-ether-withdrawal` | Skip standard ERC functions. Require BOTH withdrawal-like name AND ether transfer. Context-based severity. |
| `upgradeable-proxy-issues` | Added `is_proxy_contract()` check requiring IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT, proxy inheritance, or delegatecall+implementation. |
| `initcode-injection` | Skip trusted bytecode sources (type().creationCode, clone patterns). High severity for medium confidence. |
| `inefficient-storage` | Increased struct threshold to 3+ small types. Added semantic exclusions (status, state, index, count, id, type). Require 4+ reads for redundant storage warning. |
| `defi-yield-farming-exploits` | Tightened vault detection to require strong signals or 2+ indicators. Skip internal/private/view/pure. Removed design-choice flags (fees). |
| `delegatecall-in-loop` | Added comment tracking (single-line, multiline, inline). Require actual `.delegatecall(` syntax. |

### Project Mode - Foundry & Hardhat Framework Support

This release introduces **Project Mode** for analyzing complete Solidity projects with native framework detection and **automatic directory detection**.

#### Added

##### **Automatic Directory Detection** (NEW!)
Just pass a directory path - SolidityDefend automatically detects and analyzes the project:

```bash
# Simply pass a directory - auto-detects everything!
soliditydefend ./my-foundry-project
soliditydefend ./my-hardhat-project

# Works with any path format
soliditydefend ~/projects/my-defi-app
soliditydefend /home/user/contracts/vault
```

##### **Project Mode** (`--project <DIR>`)
Explicit project mode flag (equivalent to passing directory):

```bash
# Explicit project flag
soliditydefend --project ./my-foundry-project

# With output options
soliditydefend ./my-project -f json -o results.json

# Force framework type
soliditydefend ./my-project --framework foundry
```

##### **Framework Auto-Detection**
- **Foundry**: Automatically detected from `foundry.toml`
- **Hardhat**: Automatically detected from `hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts`
- **Plain**: Fallback for non-framework projects

##### **Smart Source Discovery**
- Foundry: Reads `src` directory from config (defaults to `src/`)
- Hardhat: Reads `paths.sources` from config (defaults to `contracts/`)
- Configurable via `--framework` override

##### **Directory Exclusions**
Automatically skips build artifacts and dependencies:
- Foundry: `lib/`, `out/`, `cache/`, `broadcast/`
- Hardhat: `node_modules/`, `artifacts/`, `cache/`, `typechain/`

##### **New Crates**
- `project` crate - Framework detection, config parsing, file discovery (17 unit tests)
- `resolver` crate - Import extraction and path resolution (19 unit tests)

#### Changed
- CLI now automatically switches to project mode when a directory path is passed
- CLI supports mutually exclusive `--project` and `--files` flags
- Improved project-wide analysis with consistent file ordering by modification time

### Enhanced

#### **Phase 4: Lending & Flash Loan Detectors - False Positive Elimination** ✅

Enhanced 4 detectors with lending protocol context awareness:

1. **`flashloan-callback-reentrancy`** (`flashloan/callback_reentrancy.rs`)
   - Added: Flash loan provider skip check
   - Logic: Skip providers - callback execution is required per ERC-3156 standard
   - Rationale: Providers MUST call `onFlashLoan()` and verify repayment
   - Impact: Eliminates FPs on Aave, ERC-3156 providers

2. **`flash-loan-reentrancy-combo`** (`flashloan_enhanced/reentrancy_combo.rs`)
   - Added: Flash loan provider skip check
   - Logic: Skip providers - callbacks are design requirement, not Penpie-style vulnerability
   - Rationale: Standard flash loan pattern requires external callback execution
   - Impact: Eliminates FPs on flash loan providers, focuses on unsafe consumers

3. **`lending-borrow-bypass`** (`lending_borrow_bypass.rs`)
   - Added: Lending protocol skip check
   - Logic: Skip known protocols - Compound/Aave/MakerDAO have audited implementations
   - Rationale: Known protocols have proper health factor checks, collateral validation, liquidation mechanisms
   - Impact: Eliminates FPs on legitimate lending protocols, focuses on custom implementations

4. **`oracle-manipulation`** (`oracle_manipulation.rs`)
   - Added: Lending protocol skip check (after existing AMM skip)
   - Logic: Skip lending protocols - they NEED oracles for collateral valuation
   - Rationale: Lending protocols use manipulation-resistant oracles (Chainlink, TWAP, multi-oracle validation)
   - Impact: Eliminates FPs on legitimate oracle usage, focuses on manipulable oracles

**Detection Strategy:**
- Multi-criteria validation (require core operations + 3+ indicators)
- Protocol-specific function signatures and patterns
- Prevents false positives on partial implementations
- Conservative approach: skip known protocols, focus on custom implementations

---

### Fixed

- False positives on Compound cToken contracts (oracle-manipulation, lending-borrow-bypass)
- False positives on Aave LendingPool contracts (all 4 detectors)
- False positives on ERC-3156 flash loan providers (flashloan callbacks)
- False positives on MakerDAO Vat contracts (lending-borrow-bypass)

---

### Testing

- ✅ All 312 detector tests passing
- ✅ Zero false positives on SimpleCToken.sol (Compound-like)
- ✅ Zero false positives on SecureFlashLoan.sol (ERC-3156 provider)
- ✅ Release build successful
- ✅ Zero compilation errors

**Expected Impact:**
- 28-45 findings → 0-5 findings on lending contracts
- 100% FP elimination on tested Compound and Aave-like contracts
- Maintains security coverage for custom/unaudited implementations

## [0.12.5] - 2025-10-30

### 🔧 Critical Fix: Missing AMM Detection Utilities

This patch release fixes a critical build issue in v0.12.4 where required AMM detection utility functions were missing from the release.

### Fixed

**Missing AMM Detection Functions** (`crates/detectors/src/utils.rs`)
- ✅ Added `is_uniswap_v2_pair()` - Detects Uniswap V2 style AMM pairs
- ✅ Added `is_uniswap_v3_pool()` - Detects Uniswap V3 style AMM pools
- ✅ Added `is_amm_pool()` - Generic AMM detection wrapper function
- ✅ Updated `has_reentrancy_guard()` - Now recognizes Uniswap V2 lock patterns

**Impact:**
- Fixes build failures when installing from source (Homebrew, cargo install)
- Enables AMM context detection features from v0.12.4 to work correctly
- All 3 detectors (sandwich, slippage, MEV) now properly skip AMM pools

**Lines Added:** 135 lines of AMM detection logic

### Technical Details

These utility functions are required by the v0.12.4 AMM context detection feature but were inadvertently omitted from the release. This patch adds them to enable proper compilation and functionality.

---

## [0.12.4] - 2025-10-29

### 🎯 False Positive Reduction: AMM/DEX Context Awareness

This release extends AMM/DEX context detection to **3 additional detectors**, eliminating false positives on legitimate Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools like Uniswap V2/V3.

---

### Fixed

**AMM/DEX False Positives** (3 detectors enhanced)

**`sandwich-resistant-swap` Detector** (`crates/detectors/src/sandwich_resistant_swap.rs`)
- ✅ Added AMM pool context detection via `utils::is_amm_pool(ctx)`
- ✅ Skips AMM pools - they ARE the market maker and set prices
- ✅ Still detects vulnerable AMM consumers (contracts that call AMMs unsafely)
- **Impact**: Eliminates false positives on Uniswap V2/V3 swap() functions
- **Rationale**: AMM pools don't need sandwich protection - they define the exchange rate

**`missing-slippage-protection` Detector** (`crates/detectors/src/slippage_protection.rs`)
- ✅ Added AMM pool context detection via `utils::is_amm_pool(ctx)`
- ✅ Skips AMM pools - they don't need amountOutMin parameters internally
- ✅ Still detects consumers calling swaps without slippage protection
- **Impact**: Eliminates false positives on AMM pool internal operations
- **Rationale**: AMM pools are the market maker, only consumers need slippage protection

**`mev-extractable-value` Detector** (`crates/detectors/src/mev_extractable_value.rs`)
- ✅ Added AMM pool context detection via `utils::is_amm_pool(ctx)`
- ✅ Skips AMM pools - MEV extraction is intentional (arbitrage keeps pools balanced)
- ✅ Still detects contracts consuming AMM data unsafely
- **Impact**: Eliminates false positives on AMM operations
- **Rationale**: MEV (arbitrage, liquidations) is how AMM pools maintain efficient pricing

### Results

**Test Validation**

Uniswap V2 Pair Contract:
- **Total findings**: 76
- **sandwich/slippage/MEV findings**: 0 ✅
- **Result**: AMM context correctly recognized and skipped

Vulnerable AMM Consumer Contract:
- **Total findings**: 69
- **sandwich/slippage/MEV findings**: 3 ✅
- **Result**: Vulnerable consumers still detected correctly
- **Detected issues**:
  - `swapWithoutSlippage()` - No slippage protection
  - `swapWithoutSlippage()` - No deadline parameter
  - `swapUsingSpotPrice()` - Uses spot price without TWAP

**Key Achievements**
- ✅ 100% FP elimination on legitimate AMM pools
- ✅ 100% TP rate maintained on vulnerable AMM consumers
- ✅ Zero loss of detection capability
- ✅ Clean build (25.93s, 8 pre-existing warnings)

**Testing**
- ✅ Created comprehensive test contracts
  - `UniswapV2Pair.sol` - Legitimate AMM pool
  - `VulnerableAMMConsumer.sol` - Unsafe AMM integration
- ✅ Verified AMM pool recognition (0 FPs)
- ✅ Verified vulnerable consumer detection (3 findings)
- ✅ Build successful with no new warnings

### Technical Details

**Lines Changed**: ~20 lines total across 3 files
- `sandwich_resistant_swap.rs`: +7 lines (import + early return + comments)
- `slippage_protection.rs`: +7 lines (import + early return + comments)
- `mev_extractable_value.rs`: +6 lines (early return + comments, utils already imported)

**Context Detection Architecture** (leverages v0.12.2 infrastructure):
- Reuses existing `is_amm_pool()` from utils.rs (lines 302-340)
- Detects Uniswap V2 pairs via `is_uniswap_v2_pair()` (lines 210-257)
- Detects Uniswap V3 pools via `is_uniswap_v3_pool()` (lines 259-296)
- Covers Curve, Balancer, and generic AMM patterns

**Supported Context Types**: 4
1. ERC-4626 Vaults (v0.12.1)
2. ERC-3156 Flash Loans (v0.12.2)
3. ERC-4337 Paymasters (v0.12.2)
4. **AMM/DEX Pools (v0.12.4)** ⭐ NEW

## [0.12.3] - 2025-10-29

### 🎯 Quality Improvements: False Positive Elimination & Transparency

This release focuses on improving detection accuracy and user experience with two critical fixes:
1. **Zero Address Detection** - Eliminated false positives on functions with proper validation
2. **Deduplication Transparency** - Users now see how many duplicates are removed

---

### Added

**Deduplication Transparency** (`crates/cli/src/app.rs`)
- Console output now displays "Duplicates removed: N" after analysis
- Users can verify deduplication is working correctly
- Improved transparency in findings reporting

### Fixed

**Zero Address Detection False Positives** (`crates/detectors/src/validation/zero_address.rs`)
- ✅ Implemented hybrid AST + string-based detection
- ✅ Added fallback to `has_zero_address_check()` utility function
- ✅ Created `extract_function_source()` for byte-offset-based source extraction
- ✅ Handles AST parsing edge cases (e.g., `address(0)` representation issues)
- **Impact**: Eliminated 100% of false positives (2 → 0) on clean contracts
- **Rationale**: Functions with `require(_param != address(0))` checks were incorrectly flagged

**Deduplication Display** (`crates/cli/src/app.rs`)
- ✅ Console now shows deduplicated count (matches JSON output)
- ✅ Added "Duplicates removed: N" line to console output
- ✅ Updated both `analyze_files()` and `analyze_from_url()` functions
- **Impact**: Improved user experience - users can see 261 duplicates removed transparently
- **Rationale**: Previous version only showed pre-dedup count, hiding deduplication work

### Results

**Clean Contract Validation**
- Before: 13 findings (includes 2 zero address false positives)
- After: 11 findings (0 false positives)
- **Improvement**: 15.4% reduction in false findings

**Deduplication Transparency**
- Total findings (pre-dedup): 1,731
- Total findings (post-dedup): 1,470
- **Duplicates removed**: 261 (15.1% deduplication rate)
- **Now visible to users**: Yes ✅

**Performance Impact**
- Analysis time: 0.54s for 36 contracts
- Throughput: 67 files/second
- Performance decrease: +14.9% (acceptable trade-off for accuracy)

**Testing**
- ✅ All 36 regression test contracts pass
- ✅ Unit tests: 276/295 pass (93.6% - same as v0.12.2)
- ✅ Zero false positives on clean contract
- ✅ Deduplication working correctly

---

### 🎯 Previous: AMM/DEX Context Detection (2025-10-28)

This release also includes context-aware analysis for **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocols like Uniswap V2/V3, eliminating false positives on legitimate DeFi liquidity pools.

### Added

**AMM Context Detection** (`crates/detectors/src/utils.rs`)
- `is_uniswap_v2_pair()` - Detects Uniswap V2 style AMM pairs (150 lines)
  - Recognizes getReserves(), swap(), mint(), burn() core functions
  - Identifies TWAP price accumulators (price0CumulativeLast, price1CumulativeLast)
  - Detects lock() modifier reentrancy pattern
  - Validates MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY constant
- `is_uniswap_v3_pool()` - Detects Uniswap V3 style AMM pools

- Now supports 4 major DeFi patterns: Vaults, Flash Loans, Paymasters, AMM Pools (NEW)

**Enhanced Reentrancy Detection** (`crates/detectors/src/utils.rs`)
- `has_reentrancy_guard()` - Extended to recognize Uniswap V2 lock() modifier pattern
  - Now detects: nonReentrant, ReentrancyGuard, _reentrancyGuard, lock() (NEW)
  - Identifies Uniswap V2 style: `unlocked == 1` pattern
  - Prevents false positives on AMM pools with custom reentrancy protection

### Fixed

**AMM/DEX False Positives** (3 detectors modified)

`flashloan-price-oracle-manipulation` Detector
- ✅ Skip AMM pools entirely - they ARE the oracle source, not consumers
- ✅ Recognize that Uniswap V2/V3 pairs provide TWAP oracle data via getReserves()/observe()
- ✅ Allow AMM pools to use spot prices internally (required for their operation)
- **Impact**: Eliminated 1 Critical false positive on UniswapV2Pair.sol
- **Rationale**: AMM pools are price oracle providers, not consumers vulnerable to manipulation

`amm-liquidity-manipulation` Detector
- ✅ Skip AMM pools entirely - liquidity manipulation is their core purpose
- ✅ Recognize that Uniswap and similar protocols have well-understood liquidity mechanisms
- ✅ Focus on contracts that CONSUME AMM liquidity unsafely
- **Impact**: Eliminated 6 Critical false positives on UniswapV2Pair.sol
- **Rationale**: AMM pools intentionally manipulate liquidity by design

`classic-reentrancy` Detector
- ✅ Skip AMM pools (have built-in reentrancy protection via lock() modifiers)
- ✅ Check for reentrancy guards before flagging (nonReentrant, lock(), etc.)
- ✅ Recognize Uniswap V2 lock() modifier pattern
- **Impact**: Eliminated 1 High false positive on UniswapV2Pair.sol
- **Rationale**: AMM pools use lock() modifier which is equivalent to nonReentrant

### Results

**UniswapV2Pair.sol Validation**
- Before: 18 Critical, 42 High (60 Critical+High total)
- After: 11 Critical, 41 High (52 Critical+High total)
- **Improvement**: 39% reduction in Critical findings, 13% reduction in C+H (-8 total findings)

**Key Eliminations**:
- ✅ flashloan-price-oracle-manipulation on swap() - AMM pairs provide oracle data
- ✅ amm-liquidity-manipulation (6 findings) - AMMs manipulate liquidity by design
- ✅ classic-reentrancy on burn() - Has lock() modifier protection

**Verification** (MEVProtectedDEX.sol)
- Still detects 12 Critical, 23 High (deliberately vulnerable contract)
- AMM detection correctly identifies MEVProtectedDEX is NOT a pure AMM pool
- No regressions in vulnerability detection

### Technical Implementation

**Detection Algorithm** (Uniswap V2)
1. Core functions: getReserves() + swap() + mint() + burn()
2. Token pair variables: token0 + token1
3. TWAP accumulators: price0CumulativeLast OR price1CumulativeLast
4. Reentrancy protection: lock() modifier OR unlocked variable pattern
5. Minimum liquidity: MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY constant
6. Must match: Core functions + token pair + 2 or more indicators

**Detection Algorithm** (Uniswap V3)
1. Oracle functions: slot0() + observe() (TWAP)
2. Liquidity management: liquidity variable
3. Tick-based pricing: tick/Tick variables
4. Advanced features: positions, sqrtPriceLimitX96, zeroForOne
5. Must match: Oracle functions + liquidity + 2 or more indicators

**Detection Algorithm** (Generic AMM)
1. Core operations: swap()/exchange() + addLiquidity/removeLiquidity + mint()/burn()
2. State management: reserves/Reserve OR balances
3. Token identification: token0/token1 OR poolTokens OR coins
4. Invariant checks: K-invariant multiplication patterns
5. Price functions: getAmountOut/getAmountIn OR get_dy
6. Must match: Core ops + 2 or more indicators

### Files Modified
