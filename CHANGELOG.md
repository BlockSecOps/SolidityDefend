- ✅ Recognizes nonce increment as replay protection (alternative to deadline)
- ✅ Recognizes `require(isOwner[signer])` as implicit zero address check
- ✅ Skip signature malleability check for ERC-2612 permit tokens (nonce provides replay protection)
- **Impact**: Properly secured multisig wallets and permit tokens with standard patterns no longer flagged

**`permit-signature-exploit` (4 FPs → 0 FPs)**
- ✅ Disabled public permit check (standard EIP-2612, not vulnerability)
- ✅ Disabled unlimited approvals check (standard EIP-2612 behavior)
- ✅ Disabled cancellation requirement (nonce increment is sufficient)
- ✅ Skip v value validation if zero address check exists

- **Impact**: Functions named "proposeSelfDestruct" no longer incorrectly flagged

**`diamond-selector-collision` (2 FPs → 0 FPs)**
- ✅ Skip interfaces (they have no implementation)
- **Impact**: Diamond interfaces no longer generate spurious warnings

**`extcodesize-bypass` (2 FPs → 0 FPs)**
- ✅ Recognize documented constructor limitations
- ✅ Check for companion functions (`isInConstruction`)
- **Impact**: Properly documented EXTCODESIZE usage no longer flagged

---

#### **Priority 3: Additional Detectors (2 detectors, 6 FPs eliminated)**

## [0.12.5] - 2025-10-30

### 🔧 Critical Fix: Missing AMM Detection Utilities

This patch release fixes a critical build issue in v0.12.4 where required AMM detection utility functions were missing from the release.

### Fixed

**Missing AMM Detection Functions** (`crates/detectors/src/utils.rs`)
- ✅ Added `is_uniswap_v2_pair()` - Detects Uniswap V2 style AMM pairs
- ✅ Added `is_uniswap_v3_pool()` - Detects Uniswap V3 style AMM pools
- ✅ Added `is_amm_pool()` - Generic AMM detection wrapper function
- ✅ Updated `has_reentrancy_guard()` - Now recognizes Uniswap V2 lock patterns

**Impact:**
- Fixes build failures when installing from source (Homebrew, cargo install)
- Enables AMM context detection features from v0.12.4 to work correctly
- All 3 detectors (sandwich, slippage, MEV) now properly skip AMM pools

**Lines Added:** 135 lines of AMM detection logic

### Technical Details

These utility functions are required by the v0.12.4 AMM context detection feature but were inadvertently omitted from the release. This patch adds them to enable proper compilation and functionality.

---

## [0.12.4] - 2025-10-29

### 🎯 False Positive Reduction: AMM/DEX Context Awareness

This release extends AMM/DEX context detection to **3 additional detectors**, eliminating false positives on legitimate Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools like Uniswap V2/V3.

---

### Fixed

**AMM/DEX False Positives** (3 detectors enhanced)

**`sandwich-resistant-swap` Detector** (`crates/detectors/src/sandwich_resistant_swap.rs`)
- ✅ Added AMM pool context detection via `utils::is_amm_pool(ctx)`
- ✅ Skips AMM pools - they ARE the market maker and set prices
- ✅ Still detects vulnerable AMM consumers (contracts that call AMMs unsafely)
- **Impact**: Eliminates false positives on Uniswap V2/V3 swap() functions
- **Rationale**: AMM pools don't need sandwich protection - they define the exchange rate

**`missing-slippage-protection` Detector** (`crates/detectors/src/slippage_protection.rs`)
- ✅ Added AMM pool context detection via `utils::is_amm_pool(ctx)`
- ✅ Skips AMM pools - they don't need amountOutMin parameters internally
- ✅ Still detects consumers calling swaps without slippage protection
- **Impact**: Eliminates false positives on AMM pool internal operations
- **Rationale**: AMM pools are the market maker, only consumers need slippage protection

**`mev-extractable-value` Detector** (`crates/detectors/src/mev_extractable_value.rs`)
- ✅ Added AMM pool context detection via `utils::is_amm_pool(ctx)`
- ✅ Skips AMM pools - MEV extraction is intentional (arbitrage keeps pools balanced)
- ✅ Still detects contracts consuming AMM data unsafely
- **Impact**: Eliminates false positives on AMM operations
- **Rationale**: MEV (arbitrage, liquidations) is how AMM pools maintain efficient pricing

### Results

**Test Validation**

Uniswap V2 Pair Contract:
- **Total findings**: 76
- **sandwich/slippage/MEV findings**: 0 ✅
- **Result**: AMM context correctly recognized and skipped

Vulnerable AMM Consumer Contract:
- **Total findings**: 69
- **sandwich/slippage/MEV findings**: 3 ✅
- **Result**: Vulnerable consumers still detected correctly
- **Detected issues**:
  - `swapWithoutSlippage()` - No slippage protection
  - `swapWithoutSlippage()` - No deadline parameter
  - `swapUsingSpotPrice()` - Uses spot price without TWAP

**Key Achievements**
- ✅ 100% FP elimination on legitimate AMM pools
- ✅ 100% TP rate maintained on vulnerable AMM consumers
- ✅ Zero loss of detection capability
- ✅ Clean build (25.93s, 8 pre-existing warnings)

**Testing**

- `sandwich_resistant_swap.rs`: +7 lines (import + early return + comments)
- `slippage_protection.rs`: +7 lines (import + early return + comments)
- `mev_extractable_value.rs`: +6 lines (early return + comments, utils already imported)

**Context Detection Architecture** (leverages v0.12.2 infrastructure):
- Reuses existing `is_amm_pool()` from utils.rs (lines 302-340)
- Detects Uniswap V2 pairs via `is_uniswap_v2_pair()` (lines 210-257)
- Detects Uniswap V3 pools via `is_uniswap_v3_pool()` (lines 259-296)
- Covers Curve, Balancer, and generic AMM patterns

## [0.12.3] - 2025-10-29

### 🎯 Quality Improvements: False Positive Elimination & Transparency

This release focuses on improving detection accuracy and user experience with two critical fixes:
1. **Zero Address Detection** - Eliminated false positives on functions with proper validation
2. **Deduplication Transparency** - Users now see how many duplicates are removed

---

### Added

**Deduplication Transparency** (`crates/cli/src/app.rs`)
- Console output now displays "Duplicates removed: N" after analysis
- Users can verify deduplication is working correctly
- Improved transparency in findings reporting

### Fixed

**Zero Address Detection False Positives** (`crates/detectors/src/validation/zero_address.rs`)
- ✅ Implemented hybrid AST + string-based detection
- ✅ Added fallback to `has_zero_address_check()` utility function
- ✅ Created `extract_function_source()` for byte-offset-based source extraction
- ✅ Handles AST parsing edge cases (e.g., `address(0)` representation issues)
- **Impact**: Eliminated 100% of false positives (2 → 0) on clean contracts
- **Rationale**: Functions with `require(_param != address(0))` checks were incorrectly flagged

**Deduplication Display** (`crates/cli/src/app.rs`)
- ✅ Console now shows deduplicated count (matches JSON output)
- ✅ Added "Duplicates removed: N" line to console output
- ✅ Updated both `analyze_files()` and `analyze_from_url()` functions
- **Impact**: Improved user experience - users can see 261 duplicates removed transparently
- **Rationale**: Previous version only showed pre-dedup count, hiding deduplication work

### Results

**Clean Contract Validation**
- Before: 13 findings (includes 2 zero address false positives)
- After: 11 findings (0 false positives)
- **Improvement**: 15.4% reduction in false findings

**Deduplication Transparency**
- Total findings (pre-dedup): 1,731
- Total findings (post-dedup): 1,470
- **Duplicates removed**: 261 (15.1% deduplication rate)
- **Now visible to users**: Yes ✅

**Performance Impact**
- Analysis time: 0.54s for 36 contracts
- Throughput: 67 files/second
- Performance decrease: +14.9% (acceptable trade-off for accuracy)

**Testing**
- ✅ All 36 regression test contracts pass
- ✅ Unit tests: 276/295 pass (93.6% - same as v0.12.2)
- ✅ Zero false positives on clean contract
- ✅ Deduplication working correctly

---

### 🎯 Previous: AMM/DEX Context Detection (2025-10-28)

This release also includes context-aware analysis for **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocols like Uniswap V2/V3, eliminating false positives on legitimate DeFi liquidity pools.

### Added

**AMM Context Detection** (`crates/detectors/src/utils.rs`)
- `is_uniswap_v2_pair()` - Detects Uniswap V2 style AMM pairs (150 lines)
  - Recognizes getReserves(), swap(), mint(), burn() core functions
  - Identifies TWAP price accumulators (price0CumulativeLast, price1CumulativeLast)
  - Detects lock() modifier reentrancy pattern
  - Validates MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY constant
- `is_uniswap_v3_pool()` - Detects Uniswap V3 style AMM pools
  - Recognizes slot0() and observe() TWAP oracle functions
  - Identifies tick-based liquidity management
  - Validates concentrated liquidity patterns

- Now supports 4 major DeFi patterns: Vaults, Flash Loans, Paymasters, AMM Pools (NEW)

**Enhanced Reentrancy Detection** (`crates/detectors/src/utils.rs`)
- `has_reentrancy_guard()` - Extended to recognize Uniswap V2 lock() modifier pattern
  - Now detects: nonReentrant, ReentrancyGuard, _reentrancyGuard, lock() (NEW)
  - Identifies Uniswap V2 style: `unlocked == 1` pattern
  - Prevents false positives on AMM pools with custom reentrancy protection

### Fixed

**AMM/DEX False Positives** (3 detectors modified)

`flashloan-price-oracle-manipulation` Detector
- ✅ Skip AMM pools entirely - they ARE the oracle source, not consumers
- ✅ Recognize that Uniswap V2/V3 pairs provide TWAP oracle data via getReserves()/observe()
- ✅ Allow AMM pools to use spot prices internally (required for their operation)
- **Impact**: Eliminated 1 Critical false positive on UniswapV2Pair.sol
- **Rationale**: AMM pools are price oracle providers, not consumers vulnerable to manipulation

`amm-liquidity-manipulation` Detector
- ✅ Skip AMM pools entirely - liquidity manipulation is their core purpose
- ✅ Recognize that Uniswap and similar protocols have well-understood liquidity mechanisms
- ✅ Focus on contracts that CONSUME AMM liquidity unsafely
- **Impact**: Eliminated 6 Critical false positives on UniswapV2Pair.sol
- **Rationale**: AMM pools intentionally manipulate liquidity by design

`classic-reentrancy` Detector
- ✅ Skip AMM pools (have built-in reentrancy protection via lock() modifiers)
- ✅ Check for reentrancy guards before flagging (nonReentrant, lock(), etc.)
- ✅ Recognize Uniswap V2 lock() modifier pattern
- **Impact**: Eliminated 1 High false positive on UniswapV2Pair.sol
- **Rationale**: AMM pools use lock() modifier which is equivalent to nonReentrant

### Results

**UniswapV2Pair.sol Validation**
- Before: 18 Critical, 42 High (60 Critical+High total)
- After: 11 Critical, 41 High (52 Critical+High total)
- **Improvement**: 39% reduction in Critical findings, 13% reduction in C+H (-8 total findings)

**Key Eliminations**:
- ✅ flashloan-price-oracle-manipulation on swap() - AMM pairs provide oracle data
- ✅ amm-liquidity-manipulation (6 findings) - AMMs manipulate liquidity by design

2. Token pair variables: token0 + token1
3. TWAP accumulators: price0CumulativeLast OR price1CumulativeLast
4. Reentrancy protection: lock() modifier OR unlocked variable pattern
5. Minimum liquidity: MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY constant
6. Must match: Core functions + token pair + 2 or more indicators

**Detection Algorithm** (Uniswap V3)
1. Oracle functions: slot0() + observe() (TWAP)
2. Liquidity management: liquidity variable
3. Tick-based pricing: tick/Tick variables
4. Advanced features: positions, sqrtPriceLimitX96, zeroForOne
5. Must match: Oracle functions + liquidity + 2 or more indicators

**Detection Algorithm** (Generic AMM)
1. Core operations: swap()/exchange() + addLiquidity/removeLiquidity + mint()/burn()
2. State management: reserves/Reserve OR balances
3. Token identification: token0/token1 OR poolTokens OR coins
4. Invariant checks: K-invariant multiplication patterns
5. Price functions: getAmountOut/getAmountIn OR get_dy

- ✅ Skip "external call requirement" check for vaults (asset transfers are required)
- ✅ Skip "no withdrawal cap" check for vaults (built-in limits via share balances)
- **Impact**: Eliminated ~1 High false positive per vault contract

### Improvements

**Detection Quality** (Comprehensive validation on 8 clean contracts)
- **Before v0.12.1**: 117 Critical+High findings (46 Critical, 71 High)
- **After v0.12.1**: 100 Critical+High findings (36 Critical, 64 High)
- **Result**: 17 fewer Critical+High false positives (-14.5% reduction)
  - 10 fewer Critical FPs (-21.7%)
  - 7 fewer High FPs (-9.9%)
  - **Vault contracts**: Average 28% FP reduction

// Requires at least 3 of 4 core functions + share/asset mentions
- deposit(), withdraw(), redeem(), totalAssets()
- Contains "shares"/"_shares" and "asset"/"_asset"
```

**Vault-Specific Patterns Recognized as Safe**
1. Share minting without max supply caps (shares backed by assets)
2. Direct totalSupply modification (for share tracking)
3. Asset transfers via external calls (required behavior)
4. No per-transaction caps (built-in limits via maxRedeem/maxWithdraw)

### Notes

- All 100 detectors remain fully functional
