## Verification

```
cargo build --release         ✅ Success
cargo test --workspace        ✅ 685 passed, 0 failed
--validate --ground-truth     ✅ 77/77 TPs, 100% recall
```

## Changes in v14

- Removed 174 detector registrations from `registry.rs`
- Removed ~125 `pub mod` declarations from `lib.rs`
- Cleaned `fp_filter.rs` ADMIN_SUPPRESSIBLE_PREFIXES
- Updated test files (test_front_running.rs, test_proxy_security.rs)
- Updated documentation (README.md, docs/detectors/README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
