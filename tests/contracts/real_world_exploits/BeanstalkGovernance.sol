/**
 * @title Beanstalk Farms Governance (Apr 2022 - $182M stolen)
 * @notice Simplified version of the Beanstalk governance flash loan exploit.
 *
 * VULNERABILITY: Voting power was based on current token balance at the time
 * of voting, with no snapshot or time-lock mechanism. An attacker could:
 *
 * Attack flow:
 * 1. Flash loan ~$1B worth of tokens (BEAN, LUSD, etc.)
 * 2. Deposit tokens to acquire governance voting power (Stalk)
 * 3. Submit a malicious proposal (BIP-18) that transfers all funds
 * 4. Vote on and execute the proposal in the same transaction
 * 5. Drain protocol funds (~$182M) to attacker-controlled address
 * 6. Repay flash loan, keep the profit
 *
 * Root cause: No time-lock on proposal execution + voting power derived
 * from current balance (susceptible to flash loans) + emergencyCommit()
 * allowed instant execution if quorum was met.
