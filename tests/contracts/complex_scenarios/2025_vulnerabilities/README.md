## Contributing

When adding new vulnerable contracts:

1. **Document all vulnerabilities** clearly in comments
2. **Provide attack scenarios** with step-by-step explanations
3. **Include realistic complexity** that mirrors production contracts
4. **Test with SolidityDefend** to validate detection capabilities
5. **Update this README** with new vulnerability patterns

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **WARNING**: These contracts contain intentional vulnerabilities and should NEVER be deployed to production networks. They are designed solely for security testing and educational purposes.

The vulnerabilities implemented here are based on real attack patterns observed in the wild and should be used to improve security tooling and developer education.
